      "description": "Don't be intimidated. Modern AI can feel like magic, but underneath the hood are principles that web developers can understand, even if you don't have a machine learning background. In this workshop, we'll explore a complete GPT-2 inference implementation built entirely in Vanilla JS. This JavaScript translation of the popular \"Spreadsheets-are-all-you-need\" approach will let you debug and step through a real LLM line by line without the overhead of learning a new language, framework, or even IDE.\r\n\r\nAll the major LLMs, including ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, and Llama, inherit from GPT-2's architecture, making this exploration a solid foundation to understand modern AI systems and comprehend the latest research.\r\n\r\nWhile we won't have time to cover *everything*, you'll gain the essential knowledge to understand the key concepts that matter when building with LLMs, including how they:\r\n\r\n-Convert raw text into meaningful tokens\r\n- Represent semantic meaning through vector embeddings\r\n- Train neural networks through gradient descent\r\n- Generate text with sampling algorithms like top-k, top-p, and temperature\r\n\r\nThis intense but beginner-friendly workshop is designed specifically for web developers diving into ML and AI for the first time. It’s your \"missing AI degree\" in just two hours. You'll walk away with an intuitive mental model of how Transformers work that you can apply immediately to your own LLM-powered projects.",

This architecture was inspired by decades of AI and machine learning development in Google Search, reinvented for the modern LLM stack by our team over the past year. \r\n\r\nWe will share the history of that trajectory and then dive into the technical details: the use of encoder models trained specifically for scoring to enable higher accuracy and lower latency and the deployment of auto-generated tunable metric trees that can combine a wide variety of soft and hard signals across your stack into a human-calibrated score. We’ll end with various examples of how these scoring models are being deployed across the whole stack from online control flows for agents, to reward models for algorithms like RL, to rankers for inference time scaling methods like ensemble generation.\r\n",

Inspired by the complexity of human memory systems—such as episodic, working, semantic, and procedural memory—this talk unpacks how AI agents can achieve believability, reliability, and capability by retaining and reasoning over past experiences.\r\nWe’ll begin by establishing a conceptual framework based on real-world implementations from memory management libraries and system architectures:\r\nMemory Components representing various structured memory types (e.g., conversation, workflow, episodic, persona)\r\nMemory Modes reflecting operational strategies for short-term, long-term, and dynamic memory handling\r\nNext, the talk transitions to practical implementation patterns critical for effective memory lifecycle management:\r\nMaintaining rich conversation history and contextual awareness\r\nPersistence strategies leveraging vector databases and hybrid search\r\nMemory augmentation using embeddings, relevance scoring, and semantic retrieval\r\nProduction-ready practices for scaling memory in multi-agent ecosystems\r\nWe’ll also examine advanced memory strategies within agentic systems:\r\nMemory cascading and selective deletion\r\nIntegration of tool use and persona memory\r\nOptimizing performance around memory retrieval and LLM context window limits\r\nWhether you're developing autonomous agents, chatbots, or complex workflow orchestration systems, this talk offers knowledge and tactical insights for building AI that can remember, adapt, and improve over time.\r\nThis session is ideal for:\r\nAI engineers and agent framework developers\r\nArchitects designing Agentic RAG or multi-agent systems\r\nPractitioners building contextual, personalized AI experiences\r\nBy the end of the session, you’ll understand how to leverage memory as a strategic asset in agentic design—and walk away ready to build agents that not only act and reason but also remember.\t",

Conventional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) methods face limitations in capturing these nuanced interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. In our talk, we introduce a novel approach integrating Knowledge Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) with VectorRAG, designed to refine question-answering (Q&A) systems for more effective information extraction from complex texts. Our approach employs a dual retrieval strategy that harnesses both knowledge graphs and vector databases, enabling the generation of precise and contextually appropriate answers, thereby setting a new standard for LLMs in processing sophisticated data.",

These were not tenable before because of the amount of customization required per customer or per scenario, and the kind of data involved in these workflows. Previously, these workflows were driven manually which were both error prone and required expensive training. \r\n\r\nTo replace or augment these manual business critical processes, automation _has_ to cross a very high bar of reliability. \r\n\r\nWe will share how we addressed the inherent non-determinism of Gen AI to create a predictable system that doesn’t have any surprising failure modes. We’ll also discuss how we worked with our existing data that was spread across various systems without an expensive centralisation and clean up effort. ",

They build from either the model out or the app layer down. But unless you start with the network layer and build up, you'll never be able to deliver realtime audio and video streams reliably. And perhaps even worse, you'll get core primitives wrong: interruption handling, conversation state management, asynchronous function calling.\r\n\r\nSean and Kwin agree on most things: old-school realtime systems people against the rest of the world. But they disagree on some important things, too, and will argue about those things live on stage. Do you need to give developers \"thick\" client-side realtime SDKs? Can you build truly great vendor neutral APIs? (You'll be surprised which of them argues which side, on that topic.)",

Most of them are rolling the stack themselves. I don't see a lot of frameworks in production customer-facing agents.\r\n\r\nI've been surprised to find that most of the products out there billing themselves as \"AI Agents\" are not all that agentic. A lot of them are mostly deterministic code, with LLM steps sprinkled in at just the right points to make the experience truly magical.\r\n\r\nAgents, at least the good ones, don't follow the \"here's your prompt, here's a bag of tools, loop until you hit the goal\" pattern.

      "description": "AI-powered agents promise faster, easier software delivery, but their unpredictable behavior often makes engineers hesitant to fully trust them with critical workflows. Sam Alba, Co-founder of Dagger (and previously co-creator of Docker), explains how teams can reliably integrate agents into their delivery pipelines by shifting how they structure and manage automation.\r\n\r\nHe'll share four practical strategies learned from real-world experience:\r\n\r\n1. Treat agents as workflow participants, not isolated tools.\r\nStop using agents as disconnected scripts or IDE plugins. Treating them as first-class parts of your delivery process simplifies your architecture, reduces hidden complexity, and makes agent outcomes more predictable.\r\n\r\n2. Use many small agents instead of one big one.\r\nJust as software evolved from monoliths to microservices, software delivery benefits from smaller, specialized agents with clearly defined responsibilities. Smaller agents are easier to understand, maintain, and integrate.\r\n\r\n3. Define clear environments—the real lever for reliability.\r\nInstead of chasing perfect prompts or models, focus on clearly defining the tools, resources, and permissions around your agents. Precisely controlling their environments makes agents behave consistently and reliably.\r\n\r\n4. Design workflows for easy debugging and observability.\r\nAgents will sometimes fail unexpectedly. Sam will share simple, effective ways to build clear tracing and observability into your workflows from the start, making debugging quicker and less frustrating.\r\n\r\nYou'll leave with practical, immediately usable techniques that give you the confidence to trust AI agents in your software delivery pipelines.",

      "description": "AI Agents are distributed systems. Agents need to connect and communicate with tools, data repositories, other agents, etc., all over a network. Event-Driven Architecture is a common pattern for facilitating this connectivity, using Events as the communication abstraction. However, this pattern introduces complexities as well, such as fragmented logic, increased latency, decreased observability, and more. But what if there were a way to get the benefits of Event-Driven Architecture without the complexities? Enter Durable Execution. In this talk, we'll discuss the pitfalls of Event-Driven Architecture, how Durable Execution solves these issues, and why Durable Execution, not Events, is the correct abstraction for building AI Agents.",

How can we adapt MCP for autonomous agents?\r\n- Many Common Problems: MCP is great, but what can go wrong? How can you work around it? Can the protocol be extended to solve these issues?\r\n- Monitoring Complex Phenomena: How does observability work (and not work) with MCP?\r\n- Multiple Competing Protocols: A quick run-through of other agent communication protocols like A2A and AGNTCY, and probably a few more by June 😴\r\n- Massive Crustaceans Party: What might success look like if everything goes to plan?",

This fragmented approach results in delayed resolutions, repeated incidents, escalations, and dissatisfied stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThis session explores an innovative solution leveraging the synergy of natural language processing from IT Service Management (ITSM) systems, Multi-agent reasoning, and dynamic context derived from live knowledge network graphs. Attendees will gain insights into an end-to-end architecture where natural language intents from ITSM tickets seamlessly integrate with experts AI agents for complex workflow tasks, supported by continuous network knowledge graph ingestion pipelines.\r\n\r\nThrough a detailed production case study, we will demonstrate how Agentic reasoning combined with dynamic network knowledge graph contexts significantly improves critical validation and workflow interactions. The showcased results will highlight dramatic improvements in ticket resolution efficiency, accuracy of network testing, and overall execution quality, delivering tangible value to both technical teams and business stakeholders.",

Oops, you’ve just stepped into a minefield:\r\n\r\n-Not low-latency enough? Choppy experience. Users churn from your app. \r\n-Not cheap enough? You’re losing money on every query.\r\n-Not high enough output quality? Your system can’t be used for that application.\r\n\r\nA model and the inference system around it form a “token factory” associated with a Pareto frontier— a curve representing the best possible trade-offs between cost, throughput, latency and quality, outside of which your LLM system cannot be applied successfully. \r\n\r\nOutside of the Pareto frontier? You’re back to square one.\r\nThat is, unless you’re able to change the shape of the Pareto frontier.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we’ll introduce NVIDIA Dynamo, a datacenter-scale distributed inference framework as well as the bleeding-edge techniques it enables to hack the Pareto frontier of your inference systems, including:\r\n\r\n-Disaggregation - separating phases of LLM generation to make them more efficient\r\n-Speculation - predicting multiple tokens per cycle\r\n-KV routing, storage, and manipulation - ensuring that we don’t redo work that has already been done\r\n-Pipelining improvements for agents - accelerating our workflows using information about the agent\r\n\r\nBy the end of the talk, we’ll understand how the Pareto frontier limits where models can be applied, the intuition behind how inference techniques can be used to modify it, as well as the mechanics of how these techniques work.\r\n",

      "description": "YouTube recommendations drive nearly two-thirds of the platform's staggering 5 billion daily watch hours for 2 billion+ DAU. Traditionally powered by large embedding models (LEMs), we're undertaking a fundamental shift: rebuilding our recommendation stack using foundation models like Gemini. This talk dives into our engineering journey adapting general-purpose LLMs (Gemini) for the highly specialized, dynamic, and massive-scale task of YouTube recommendations.\r\n\r\nWe'll start with a critical first step: creating a \"language\" for YouTube videos. Learn how we developed 'SemanticID', a novel tokenization scheme that distills multimodal video features (text, audio, frames) into discrete tokens representable by an LLM. Our paper (Better Generalization with Semantic IDs: A Case Study in Ranking for Recommendations) is a landmark work in this space.  \r\n\r\nWe then adapt the base Gemini checkpoint to understand sequences of these video tokens alongside natural language, effectively teaching it the grammar of user watch behavior. A key insight: unlike static LLM training, YouTube's corpus evolves so rapidly (millions of new videos daily) that daily retraining is non-negotiable to maintain recommendation quality.\r\n\r\nNow we can prompt LRM with user history and context to generate personalized candidate recommendations, achieving the biggest engagement wins on YouTube in the last ~decade. \r\n\r\nThere’s a lot of attention on the LLM-led transformation of Search (with AI Overviews, Perplexity, ChatGPT-Search etc). However, across large consumer apps, it’s the recommendation systems & feeds that drive most consumer engagement, not just search (eg. YouTube recs drive 67% of WatchTime). This talk is about the LLM-led transformation of recommendations & feeds – building a recommendation engine on top of Gemini.\r\n",

We will do a deep dive on the capabilities that the Gemini Live API combined with Pipecat unlock for devs with special focus on session management, turn detection, tool use (including async function calls), proactivity, multilinguality and integration with telephony and other infra. We will demo some of the more innovative capabilities. We will also talk through some customer use cases - especially how customers can use Pipecat to extend these realtime multimodal capabilities to client side applications such as customer support agents, gaming agents, tutoring agents etc. In addition, we also have an experimental version of the Live API powered by with Google's native audio offering that can be tried in an experimental capacity . This experimental model  can communicate with seamless, emotive, steerable, multilingual dialogue and enhances use cases where more natural voices can be a big differentiator. ",

Building reliable, deployable systems with unpredictable LLMs feels like wrestling fog – testing outputs alone is insufficient when the underlying workflow is opaque and flaky. How do we move beyond fragile prototypes?\r\n\r\nThis talk, from the creator of Docker, argues the solution lies *outside* the model: engineering **reproducible execution workflows** built on rigorous architectural discipline. Learn how **containerization**, applied not just to deployment but to *each individual step* of an agent's workflow, provides the essential **isolation and environmental consistency** needed.\r\n\r\nDiscover how combining this granular container approach with patterns like immutable state management allows us to **contain agent chaos**, unlock effective testing, simplify debugging, and bring essential control and predictability back to building powerful AI agents you can actually ship with confidence.",

      "title": "Monetizing AI: From Zero to Profit",
      "description": "As AI continues to transform industries, companies are faced with the critical challenge of effectively monetizing AI-driven products in a way that captures value, ensures customer adoption, and scales revenue sustainably. Unlike traditional SaaS models, AI-powered products have unique complexities - such as fluctuating usage patterns, variable compute costs, and evolving customer demands, making conventional pricing strategies unhelpful to the growth of an AI product-led startup.\r\n\r\nIn this session, Alvaro Morales, CEO and co-founder of Orb, will explore why the often overlooked monetization aspect of AI is critical for businesses. He’ll share real-world examples and data to demonstrate how adaptive pricing models can drive cost savings, enhance customer experience, and reduce operational bottlenecks.\r\n\r\nAlvaro will lead a live demo, showcasing how engineers can simulate AI pricing strategies and subsequently integrate them with a simple plug-and-play solution. He’ll also share how real-world revenue simulations enable companies to test and refine pricing before implementing — reducing risk, boosting adoption, and unlocking new revenue streams. As a quick example, cloud software development platform Replit was looking to adopt a usage-based pricing model for a new product, but their existing billing system couldn't support the new model, and building a new billing system would delay the launch timeline. In order to get things done, they turned to Orb, which enabled them to make pricing changes up to the last minute. After the launch, Orb became the single source of truth for both Replit and its customers - providing usage alerts to notify Replit when users hit cost thresholds and provide insights into user spend and payment methods.\r\n\r\nKey takeaways: \r\nThe challenge of AI monetization – Why traditional subscription-based SaaS pricing models don’t work for AI-powered products.\r\nPrecision pricing – Exploring how usage-based, tiered, and hybrid pricing models can maximize revenue potential. \r\nRevenue simulation for AI pricing – Leveraging real-time data to test, adjust and optimize pricing strategies.\r\nAvoiding common pricing pitfalls – Identifying mistakes that can lead to revenue leakage and customer churn.\r\n\r\nThis session is designed for AI executives, product leaders, and engineering teams looking for actionable strategies to build adaptive, scalable pricing models that drive long-term growth and profitability.\r\n\r\n",

The answer is two fold: \r\n1. really really good tools \r\n2. carefully tailored agent reasoning over these tools that range from assistant-to-automation based UXs.  \r\n\r\nThe main goal of this talk is to a practical overview of agent architectures that can automate real-world work, with a focus on document-centric tasks. Learn the core building blocks of best-in-class \"tools\" around processing, manipulating, and indexing/retrieving PDFs to Excel spreadsheets. Also learn the range of agent architectures suited for different tasks, from chat assistant-based UXs with high human-in-the-loop, to automation UXs that rely on encoding a business process into an end-to-end task solver. These architectures have to be generalizable but also highly accurate as agents get increasingly better at reasoning and code-writing. ",

      "description": "The sheer volume of data and complexity of modern scientific challenges necessitate tools that go beyond mere analysis. The vision of an \"AI Co-scientist\" – a true collaborative partner in the lab – requires sophisticated engineering to bridge the gap between powerful AI reasoning and the dynamic reality of physical experiments. This talk dives into the engineering required to build robust AI Co-scientists for hands-on research. We will explore scalable architectures, such as multi-agent systems leveraging foundation models like Gemini for complex reasoning, hypothesis refinement (inspired by the \"generate, debate, evolve\" paradigm described in recent AI Co-scientist research), and intelligent tool use. The core focus will be on the engineering challenges and solutions for integrating diverse, real-time empirical data streams – visual data from cameras, quantitative readings from sensors, positional feedback from actuators, and instrument outputs – directly into the AI's reasoning loop. I will illustrate this with concrete, technically detailed examples in chemistry (adaptive reaction monitoring), robotics (vision-guided assembly with SO Arm 100 and LeRobot library), and synthetic biology (real-time bacterial growth monitoring & interpretation). We'll discuss engineering strategies for handling data heterogeneity, latency, noise, and enabling the AI to interpret, correlate, and act upon live experimental feedback. Finally, we will touch upon how thoughtful engineering of these AI Co-scientists can contribute to democratizing access to advanced scientific capabilities.\r\n",

As users rely more heavily on these systems, evaluating their quality becomes mission-critical. But traditional metrics like precision and recall don’t capture the full picture.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we introduce a practical evaluation framework for AI-powered search, across three dimensions:\r\n- Are the retrieved sources relevant to the query?\r\n- And is the final answer complete?\r\n- Are the sources faithfully used in the generated answer?\r\n\r\nWe’ll share lessons from working with search companies and present early findings from a new benchmark evaluating popular augmented AI systems across these dimensions. Rather than ranking winners and losers, we explore where different systems excel or break down, and how these tradeoffs inform product decisions.\r\n\r\nThis talk is for AI engineers and product teams who want to build trusted, high-quality AI search experiences, and need a way to measure if it’s actually working.",

Is \"eval\" the dataset for measuring the quality of your AI system? Is \"eval\" the measure, the metric of quality? Is \"eval\" the process of human annotation and scoring? Or is \"eval\" a third-party dataset run once to benchmark a model?\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this cacophony, this talk will provide an opinionated and principled perspective for what we actually mean when we say “evaluation”, beyond the traditional for-loop-over-a-static dataset. \r\n\r\nIn particular, this perspective draws heavy inspiration from *fuzzing*, i.e. bombarding AI with simulated, unexpected user inputs to uncover corner cases at scale. This factors into sub-problems regarding:\r\n\r\n- Quality Metric. What is the actual criteria we, as humans, are using to determine if an AI system is producing good or bad responses? How do we elicit these criteria before the human SME can articulate them? How do we, as efficiently as possible, operationalize this criteria with an automated *Judge*?\r\n\r\n- Stimuli Generation. Given a metric, how do we know, with confidence, that an AI system is performing well with respect to the metric? What data is representative and sufficient for discovering all potential bugs of an AI system? And how do we generate this complex, diverse, faithful data at scale? \r\n\r\nWe will discuss in detail the philosophy, technology, and case studies behind both problems of Quality Metric and Stimuli Generation, and how they interact in concert.",

As it turns out, open-source TTS models like Orpheus have an LLM backbone that lets us use familiar tools and optimizations like TensorRT-LLM and FP8 quantization to serve the models with low latency. But client code, network infrastructure, and other outside-the-GPU factors can introduce latency in the production stack. In this talk, we'll cover the basic mechanics of TTS inference, common pitfalls to avoid in integrating them into production systems, and how to extend this high-performance system to serve customized models with voice cloning and fine-tuning.",

      "description": "Evals are straightforward—like unit tests, they confirm your model got specific test cases right.\r\n\r\nBut in the real world, your AI encounters millions of unpredictable interactions each day. How do you gauge user trust, identify frustrations, and adapt when there's no single \"correct\" output? Diving through endless logs and manually adding one eval at a time won't cut it.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll explore how leading teams are moving beyond static evals; leveraging semantic analytics, LLM teachers, and AI-powered monitoring to deeply understand user experiences at scale—building AI products that don’t just pass tests, but genuinely resonate with users.",

      "description": "Software engineers have long understood that high-quality code requires comprehensive automated testing. For decades, our industry has relied on deterministic tests with clear pass/fail outcomes to ensure reliability. \r\n\r\nHigh-quality software depends on automated testing. That's certainly true at Zed, where we're building a next-generation native IDE in Rust. Zed runs at 120 frames per second, but it would also crash once a second if we didn't maintain and run a comprehensive suite of unit tests on every change.\r\n\r\nBut what happens when AI enters the equation?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll explore how continuous integration evolves when working with AI components. \"Evals\" - parlance from the machine learning field - are fundamentally a continuation of the software testing tradition, but with a critical difference: they're inherently stochastic.\r\n\r\nZed's traditional CI goes to extreme lengths to eliminate non-determinism, as nobody likes having their pull requests blocked by flaky builds. We've even fully simulated network interactions with a deterministic random scheduler. AI components, however, forced us to confront a fundamental paradigm shift—uncertainty isn't a bug but an intrinsic feature of these systems, compelling us to embrace what we couldn't avoid.\r\n\r\nWe'll share our journey of reconceptualizing evals as \"stochastic unit tests\" - still verifying system behavior, but without binary pass/fail grades.\r\n\r\nWe'll discuss practical approaches to:\r\n- Thoughtfully building test suites for AI components\r\n- Shifting from red/green outcomes to \"shades of gray\"\r\n- Replacing build gates with trend analysis and performance monitoring\r\n- Maintaining engineering confidence despite statistical variance\r\n\r\nWhether you're incorporating AI into existing systems or building new AI-powered tools, this talk will provide practical insights into maintaining quality when determinism gives way to probability.",

From matching existing code patterns and styles to tracking how local changes affect the larger codebase, this talk digs into the technical challenges of context awareness and why simply indexing code falls short. Relive our journey tackling the core issue in the AI IDE space : balancing retrieval quality with latency constraints and scaling effectively as codebases grow. For those curious about the infrastructure behind context-aware AI, this talk offers insights into our approach of turning massive codebases into collections of useful context.",

Building LLMs in any domain demands both clarity of thought and the skill to communicate those thoughts precisely - not only to other humans but to the models themselves. Without either, we risk unpleasant surprises.\r\n\r\nThis talk dives into:\r\n\t•\tWhy prompt spaghetti and data gumbo inevitably collapse at scale, unleashing behaviors we never intended - while a rigorously versioned spec keeps safety, personality, and UX firmly aligned, and makes incidents easier and faster to diagnose and fix.\r\n\t•\tHow OpenAI’s public Model Spec provides a clear template, complemented by emerging “dev tools” that turn hazy human intent into precise, human-and-machine-readable policy.\r\n\t•\tHow deliberative alignment training teaches models to first read and reason about the spec, boosting robustness without inflating context windows.\r\n\t•\tPractical tactics for catching ambiguity, untangling contradictions, and preserving global consistency. Plus, techniques for verifying that deployed models truly follow the contract we crafted.\r\n\r\nResources: Model Spec (2025‑04‑11) and Deliberative Alignment, Guan et al., 2024.",
